title: On strategies to exploit dependencies between singing voice alignment and separation
authors: Th√©o Nguyen, Yann Teytaut, Axel Roebel
abstract: |
    Voice separation and lyrics alignment have become essential tools for studying the singing voice and singing performance. At first glance, these tasks have no evident relations: the first estimates target vocals from a mixture of several sources, while the other determines the temporal occurrence of a text along a given audio. However, recent approaches, mostly based on deep learning, revealed potential helpful dependencies between both problems. The present study precisely focuses on informing each task with the other and highlights positive impacts on separation and alignment metrics. First, this paper covers the beneficial aspect of text alignment on singing voice separation using conditioning mechanisms. Second, new phonetic annotations of the MUSDB18 dataset are proposed and shared to improve text-informed singing voice separation. Finally, voice separation is used as a key pre-processing to reinforce a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based lyrics aligner.

### Datasets

We release here three types of additionnal data related to the MUSDB18 database:

1. **Graphemic annotations** aligned with songs of the MUSDB18 dataset. The annotations are provided in the form of LAB files, which can be downloaded [here](https://anasynth.datasets.ircam.fr/text_musdb18/graphemes_aligned/graphemes_aligned.tar.gz).

2. **Phonetic annotations** aligned with songs of the MUSDB18 dataset. The annotations are provided in the form of LAB files, which can be downloaded [here](https://anasynth.datasets.ircam.fr/text_musdb18/phonemes_aligned/phonemes_aligned.tar.gz).

3. **Posteriorgrams** of the MUSDB18 dataset songs. The posteriorgrams are provided by the [ADAGIO system](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/3/1854) in the form of NPY files, which can be downloaded [here](https://anasynth.datasets.ircam.fr/text_musdb18/posteriorgrams/posteriorgrams.tar.gz) (78G needed).

You may also be interested in the raw text lyrics of the MUSDB18 dataset, which can be downloaded [here](https://anasynth.datasets.ircam.fr/text_musdb18/texts/texts.tar.gz).

### Split in training, validation and test sets

We provide the split of the MUSDB18 dataset in training, validation and test sets used in our experiments. The split is provided in the form of TXT files, which can be downloaded [here](https://anasynth.datasets.ircam.fr/text_musdb18/data_split/data_split.txt).
