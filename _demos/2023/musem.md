    A representation of the musical embedding (MusEm) space learned by the Ircam Music Explorer and Ircam Version Identifier algorithms.

This displays a 3D representation of the musical embedding (MusEm) space learned by different Ircam algorithms.

For modalities `instrumental`, `genre` and `mood`, the points represent different audio tracks that have been classified
following these categories by the Ircam Music Explorer algorithm.

For modality `versions`, the close points of the same color represent different versions of the same musical work, and 
were gathered by the Ircam Version Identifier (IVI) algorithm.

Click on a point to hear to a 30 seconds audio excerpt of the corresponding track.
